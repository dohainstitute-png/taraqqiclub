## Design and Features

###- **Color Palette:** The app uses a warm and inviting color palette inspired by Islamic architecture:
    - `--brand-khutba`: Rich, dark brown for text.
    - `--brand-minbar`: Warm brown for accents.
    - `--brand-qubba`: Deep green for backgrounds.
    - `--brand-mihrab`: Soft beige for cards.
    - `--brand-suffa`: Light cream for the page background.
- **- Typography:** The app uses a clean, sans-serif font for readability.

- **- Internationalization:** The app supports Arabic and English, with right-to-left (RTL) support for Arabic.
- **- Onboarding:** A multi-step onboarding process guides new users through the app's features.
- **- Home Feed:** The home page displays a feed of content, which is currently a placeholder.
- **- Create:** Users can create new content through a floating action button that opens a sheet with creation options.
